## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 7 of the programme. My task was to use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities to create a weather dashboard that would run in the browser and display current and future weather conditions for any city of choice. I was also to create functionality that stores previous searches in the user's browser's local storage and display these on the page to be reloaded on request. I believe I was successful in meeting the required criteria.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL: https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-6/.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome. The assignment was largely completed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and the OpenWeather API.

## Conclusion

Overall, I really enjoyed creating this application, though it was challening. I learned a lot about using external APIs and I feel as though I really advanced the development of my skills in JavaScript overall. I look forward to the next challenge and I'm also excited to test out my new skills with various different APIs.
